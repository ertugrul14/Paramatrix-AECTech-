# Code explanation
## Conversion
The conversion is done by:
```js
const { gltf, metaData } = await ifc2gltf(data);
```
which extracts gltf together with metaData.
## Importing of wasm
### Using local wasm file
By default, wasm file from npm-package is used. For particular wasm file path, use the syntax prvided with following example:
```js
const { gltf, metaData } = await ifc2gltf(dataString, "./../dist/");
```
### Using remote wasm file
You can import wasm file dynamically from CDN, using the following syntax:
```js
const { gltf, metaData } = await ifc2gltf(dataString, "remote");
```
